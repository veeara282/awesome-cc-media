### Definitely CC-licensed

| Title | Artist | License | Notes |
| ----- | ------ | ------- | ----- |
| "[Wikipedia Chanukah](https://wiki.jonathancoulton.com/Wikipedia_Chanukah)" | Jonathan Coulton, John Roderick | CC-BY-SA 3.0 | According to [Coulton's blog](https://www.jonathancoulton.com/2013/05/08/this-is-for-samuel/), this song is licensed under CC-BY-SA because it incorporates text from Wikipedia. |
| Jonathan Coulton's discography | Jonathan Coulton | CC-BY-NC 3.0 | All songs except those that include material not owned by Coulton, e.g. covers, mashups, "Still Alive", "Want You Gone", and "Wikipedia Chanukah". Check [JoCopedia](https://wiki.jonathancoulton.com/Main_Page) for licensing information on individual songs. |

### Questionably CC-licensed

Include songs here if it is questionable whether they were actually released under the corresponding license (e.g. because the licensor does not actually own the rights to the song). Many music videos licensed under CC-BY 3.0 [on YouTube](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2797468?hl=en) fall into this category.
