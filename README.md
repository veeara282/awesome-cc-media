### Questionably CC-licensed

Include songs here if it is questionable whether they were actually released under the corresponding license (e.g. because the licensor does not actually own the rights to the song). Many music videos licensed under CC-BY 3.0 [on YouTube](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2797468?hl=en) fall into this category.
